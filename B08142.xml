            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For you cannot be ignorant that your bodies (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that they haue deuoured the little round hoſtes tranſubſtantiated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fleſh and bone, and ſupt and licked the wine changed into bloud) doe die and are mortall, by the neceſſitie of the lawe.

            <p>Another like interpretation of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour<note place="margin">Conference of baptiſme vnto the ſacrament of the ſupper.</note> and authour of the ſacramentall law is diſcribed, when Ieſus Chriſt was asked of <hi>Nicodeme</hi> the meane how a man could bee regenerate and borne againe. Is it poſſible (ſaith <hi>Nicodeme</hi>) that a man ſhould enter into his mothers wombe and be borne againe? Did Ieſus Chriſt anſwere vnto this demaund, that in the holy ſacrament of Baptiſme the water was turned into the bodie, into fleſhe,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:183914:79"/> and into bloud, and tranſubſtantiate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a carnall wombe to be thereby againe engendred and borne? Is there not as great reaſon after your witchcraft here to vſe this anſwere as in the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſupper? for by the one of theſe two holy ſacraments wee be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, and by the other nouriſhed. And the regeneration is as marueilous vnto mans wiſedome, as the nouriſhment. For after mans carnall iudgement it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth vnpoſſible, twiſe to be engendred. But our good God hath vſed like inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation for the regeneration as hee did for the communion of his fleſh and his bloud, namely that theſe ſacramentall tearmes muſt be ſpiritually vnderſtood, and not carnally: for the fleſh profiteth<note place="margin">Iohn. 3.</note> nothing, but the ſpirit quickneth. That which is of the fleſhe, is fleſhly, that which is of the ſpirit, is ſpirituall.</p>
            <p>The holy Apoſtle giuing vnto the Corinthians that which hee receiued at the hand of God, did admoniſh them of the ſecond comming of Ieſus Chriſt, in

If it were otherwiſe, this ſhould not be called a ſacrament but a myracle, as when Ieſus Chriſt, turned the water into wine, that he vſed a miracle of tranſubſtantiation, changing water into wine. But he did not then ordeine a ſacrament as he did of the communion of his body &amp; bloud by the holy figures of bread and wine. Was it not as eaſie for God to make the wine to bee changed into bloud, or the bread into fleſh, as for <hi>Moyſes &amp; Aaro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

By which their faith through the working of the holy ghoſt
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:183914:123"/> as Chriſt is apprehended and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into them, &amp; hath borne a way their ſinnes vpon himſelfe, and the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due for the ſame; ſo are they alſo and euerie of them conuerted into Chriſt, and are made partakers of the righteouſnes of God in him, according as before hath been remembred: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the infinite iuſtice &amp; mercy of God moſt liuely appeareth to the eies, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, taſte and feeling of all the faithfull: infinite in iuſtice; for that no ſatisfaction could or can ſatisfie the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God for the recompence or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the leaſt ſinne in mankind, but that the ſame muſt bee fully puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for the ſatisfaction of Gods infinit iuſtice, in the true, reall &amp; naturall fleſh of man; which ſatisfaction our Sauiour Chriſt made for mankinde, who came downe from heauen and was made man of the ſubſtance of his mother, that in the fraile fleſh of mankinde hee might take vpon himſelfe and ſuffer all the puniſhment due vnto ſinners, that as
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:183914:123"/> manie as beleeued or ſhould to the end of the world beleeue in him, might not periſh but haue euerlaſting life. For chriſt in the power of his diuine nature to which hee ioyned our fleſh, ſuffered the wrath, curſe &amp; puniſhment of God due for ſinne, which no mortall crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture beeing only man, was or could bee able to beare or ouercome, for which cauſe the ſonne of God made himſelfe fleſh, to the end that according to gods infinit iuſtice the ſinnes of the faithfull might be borne away and fully puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his fleſh: wherein his infinite Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice did moſt brightly ſhine &amp; apeare.

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:183914:125"/> of his diſciples, and the Church. For which cauſe our Sauiour did inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, command, and celebrate this holy Sacrament, whiles hee was yet bodily preſent amongſt his diſciples, both for that his bodily preſence was not long to continue, but to depart away from them, whereof this Sacrament was to keepe a remembrance amongſt them; as alſo of all the benefits receiued, and to be receiued by all, and euery of the faithfull, by his moſt precious bodie &amp; bloud, giuen vp to bee crucified, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſhed for their ſinnes; whereof theſe ſacramentall elements did and would make a more liuely declaration to the ſenſes and vnderſtanding of his Diſciples, and the Church, through the grace of his holy ſpirit, working in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of their hearts, then by his bodily preſence they were able to conceiue.

Wherby it doth alſo moſt euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly appeare, that there is neither conſubſtantiation, nor tranſubſtantiation in the Sacrament; for ſeing the wicked eate &amp; drinke iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to themſelues, by their vnworthy receiuing the holy Sacrament, it muſt

For the auoyding of which fearefull and intolerable pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, it is neceſſarie to ſhew ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the preparation requiſite to be made by euery Chriſtian man, both before, and at his preſenting himſelfe to this holy table of the Lord. Before the receiuing then of the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, euery true Chriſtian man ought thus to conſider with himſelfe: Firſt, by a ſound knowledge, and good diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

The thing hee doth refuſe, or receiue, in, by, and with this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, if hee come with a true and right faith, or refuſe if he come not ſo, is Ieſus Chriſt perfect God, that made all things of nought, and perfect man, that died for man-kind on the Croſſe. Hee that receiues muſt remember and know himſelfe to bee a man, and not a beaſt, and therefore muſt preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to this Sacrament like a man, in whom the image of God is renued, through the worke &amp; grace of the holy Ghoſt, all malice and beaſtlines of ſin being ſubdued. and not ſuffered to raigne; and in ſtead thereof, true faith and godlineſſe, though not perfect, which is reſerued to the life to come, being firmely grounded and planted; leſt if he come like a beaſt, in vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes

Secondly, he muſt not preſume to come but with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, dread, and reuerence of heart: for ſeing Ieſus Chriſt, who offereth himſelfe to bee receiued is holy and all holines, he muſt labour diligenly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him, in as much deuotion &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines as hee may, earneſtly confeſſing and bewailing his former ſinnes and wickednes, and making earneſt and heartie prayers vnto God for pardon and forgiuenes of the ſame.

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:183914:144"/> for the truth vpon the earth, for they proceed from euill to worſe, and they haue not knowne mee, ſaith the lord. Let euerie one take heede of his neighbour, and truſt you not in any brother, for euery brother will vſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, and euerie friend will deale de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully, and euery one will deceiue his frend and will not ſpeake the truth, for they haue taught their tongues to ſpeake lies, and take great paines to do wickedly. Thine habitation is in the midſt of deceiuers, becauſe of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite they refuſe to know me, ſaith the lord. Therefore thus ſaith the lorde of hoſtes, behold, I will melt them, &amp; try them, for what ſhall I elſe doe for the daughter of my people? their tongue is an arrowe ſhot out, and ſpeaketh de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt; one ſpeaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but his hart he layeth waite for him. Shall I not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit them for theſe things ſaith the lord? or ſhall not my ſoule be auenged on ſuch a nation as this? Therefore thus
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:183914:144"/> ſaith the Lord God of Hoſtes, the God of Iſrael, behold, I will feede this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with wormewood, and giue them waters of gall to drinke, for death is come vp into our windowes, and is entred into our palaces, to deſtroy the children without and the yong men in the ſtreetes. Speake, thus ſaith the lord, the carkaſes of men ſhall lie euen as the dung vpon the field, and as the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full after the mower, and none ſhall ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them. Thus ſaith the Lord, let not the wiſe man glory in his wiſedom, nor the ſtrong ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> glory in his ſtrength, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the rich man glory in his riches, but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth and knoweth me; for I am the Lord which ſhew mercie, iudgement and righteouſneſſe in the earth, for in theſe things I delight, ſaith the Lord. Thus ſaith the Lord, learne not the way of the heathen, &amp; be not afraid for the ſignes of heauen, though the heathen be afraid of ſuch. Euery man is a beaſt by his owne knowledge:
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:183914:145"/> for the paſtors are become beaſts, and haue not ſought the lord, therfore haue they no vnderſtanding, and all the flocks of their paſtures are ſcattered. O Lord, I know that the way of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is not in him ſelfe, neither is it in man to walke, and to direct his ſteps. O Lord, correct me, but with iudgement, not in thine anger, leſt thou bring me to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, power out thy wrath vpon the heathen that know thee not and vpon the families that call not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy name: let me ſee thy vengeance on them, for vnto thee haue I opened my cauſe. O lord, if I diſpute with thee thou art righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teous, yet let me talke with thee of thy iudgements; wherefore doth the way of the wicked proſper? why are all they in wealth that rebelliouſly tranſgreſſe? Thou haſt planted them, and they haue taken roote, they grow and bring forth fruit, thou art neare in their mouth, &amp; farre from their reines: O lord thou haſt ordeined them for iudgement, and O GOD thou haſt eſtabliſhed them for
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:183914:145"/> correction. Giue glory to the lord your God before hee bring draknes, and or euer your feete ſtumble in the darke mountains, and whiles you looke for light he turneth it into the ſhadowe of death and make it as darkenes. But if you will not heare, this my ſoule ſhall weepe in ſecret for your pride, &amp; mine eie ſhall weepe and drop downe teares, for the crowne of your glorie ſhal come downe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your heads. O lord though our iniquities teſtifie againſt vs, deale with vs according to thy name for our rebellions are many, we haue ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the. O the hope of Iſrael, the ſaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our thereof in the time of trouble, why art thou as a ſtranger in the land, as one that paſſeth by to tarry for a night? why art thou as a man aſtonied, &amp; as a ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g man that cannot helpe? yet art thou, O lord in the middeſt of vs, &amp; thy name is called vpon vs; O forſake vs not. Thus ſaith the lord vnto this people, thus haue they delighted to wander, they haue not refrained their feete. Therfore
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:183914:146"/> hath the lord no delight in them, but he will now remember their iniquitie, and viſit their ſinnes: when they faſt I will not heare their cries, I will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them, but I will conſume them by the ſword, and by the famine and by the peſtilence. Wee acknowledge, O lord, our wickednes, and the iniquitie of our fathers, for wee haue ſinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, do not abhorre vs for thy names ſake, caſt not downe the throne of thy glory, remember and breake not thy couenant with vs. Are there any among the vanities of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that can giue raine, or can the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens giue ſhowers? is it not thou O lord our God? Therefore will we waite vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, for thou haſt made all theſe things. Then ſaid the lord vnto me, though <hi>Moiſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> ſtoode be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, yet mine affection could not be towards this people. Caſt them out of my ſight, and let them depart: and if they ſay vnto thee, whither ſhall wee depart? then tell them, thus ſaith the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:183914:146"/> lord, ſuch as are apointed to death, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death; &amp; ſuch as are for the ſword, to the ſword; and ſuch as are for famine, to the famine; &amp; ſuch as are for the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie, to the captiuitie: and I will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point ouer them foure kindes, ſaith the Lord; the ſword to ſlay, and the dogs to teare in pieces, and the fowles of the heauen, and the beaſts of the earth to deuoure, and to deſtroy. Thou haſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me, ſaith the lord, and gone back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; therfore will I ſtretch out my hand againſt thee, and deſtroy thee, for I am wearie with repenting. Thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and thy treaſures will I giue to be ſpoiled without gaine, and that for all thy ſinnes, euen in all thy borders. Behold, ſaith the lord, I will ſend out many fiſhers, and they ſhall fiſh them; and after I will ſend out many hunters, and they ſhall hunt them from euerie mountaine, and from euery hill, &amp; out of the caues of the rocks: for mine eies are vppon all their waies, they are not hid from my face, neither is their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:183914:147"/> hid from mine eies. And firſt I will recompence their iniquitie &amp; their ſinne double, becauſe they haue defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my land, and haue filled my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance with their fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The heart is deceitfull and wicked aboue all things, who can know it? I the lord ſearch the heart, and try the reines euen to giue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery

As the partrich gathereth the yong which ſhe hath not brought forth: ſo he that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth riches, and not by right, ſhall leaue them in the middeſt of his daies, and at his end ſhall be a foole. O Lord the hope of Iſrael, all that forſake thee ſhalbe confounded, they that depart fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thee ſhall bee written in the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue forſaken the Lord the fountaine of liuing waters. Heale me, O Lord, and I ſhall be whole, ſaue me, and I ſhall be ſaued, for thou art my praiſe. Then the word of the Lord came vnto me ſaying, I wil ſpeake ſodainly againſt a nation, or againſt a kingdome to pluck it vp, and to roote it out and to deſtroy it, but if this nation, againſt whom I haue pronounced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> turne from their wickednes, I will repent of the plague that I thought to bring vppon them. And I will ſpeake ſodainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a nation &amp; concerning a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to build it, and to plant it: but if
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:183914:148"/> it doe euill in my ſight, &amp; heare not my voice, I will repent of the good that I thought to doe for them Thus ſaith the Lord God of Hoſtes, the God of Iſrael, behold I will bring vpon this citie and vpon all her towns, all the plagues that I haue pronounced againſt it, becauſe they haue hardned their necks &amp; would not heare my words; but they ſaid deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately, ſurely wee will walke after our owne imaginations, and doe euery man after the ſtubbornnes of his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart. Behold, I will bring a plague vpon this place, the which whoſoeuer heareth it, his eares ſhall tingle, and I will cauſe them to fall by the ſword be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their enemies, &amp; by the hand of them that ſeeke their liues, and their carkaſes will I giue to bee meate for the fowles of heauen, and to the beaſtes of the field, and I will feed them with the fleſh of their ſonnes, and with the fleſh of their daughters, and euery one ſhal eate the fleſh of his friend, in the ſiege and ſtraitneſſe wherewith their
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:183914:148"/> enemies that ſeeke their liues ſhall hold them ſtrait. Woe bee vnto the paſtors that deſtroy &amp; ſcatter the ſheep of my paſture, ſaith the Lord. Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael vnto the paſtors that feede my people, ye haue ſcattered my flocke, and thruſt them out, and haue not viſited them. Behold I will viſit you for the wickedneſſe of your workes, ſaith the Lord: for both the Prophet and the Prieſt doe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, and their wickednes haue I found in my houſe, ſaith the Lord: wherfore their way ſhall be vnto them as ſlippe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry waies in the darkenes, they ſhall bee driuen forth, and fall therein: for I will bring a plague vpon them, euen the yeare of their viſitation, ſaith the Lord. Therefore thus ſaith the Lord concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Prophets, behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drinke the water of gall: for from the Prophets is wickednes, gone forth into all the land of Ieruſalem, they ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en alſo the hands of the wicked, that
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:183914:149"/> none can returne from their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: they are all vnto me as Sodome &amp; the inhabitants thereof as Gamorah. They ſay ſtill vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that diſpiſe me, the Lord hath ſaid, ye ſhall haue peace, and they ſay vnto euery one that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after the ſtubbornnes of his owne heart, there ſhall no euill come vpon you.

<pb n="317" facs="tcp:183914:149"/> that breaketh the ſtone? Therfore behold, I will come againſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſaith the Lord, which haue ſweet tongues, and ſay, he ſayeth, behold I will come againſt Prophets ſaith, the Lord, that ſteale my word, euery one from his neighbour: behold I wil come againſt them that prophecie falſe dreames<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaith the Lord, and doe tell them, and cauſe my people to erre by their lies and by their flatteries, and I ſent them not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor commanded them: therfore they bring no profit vnto this people, ſaith the Lord. For thus hath the Lord God of Iſrael ſpoken vnto me, take the cup of wine of this my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation at my handes, and cauſe all the nations to whom I ſend, to drinke it, and they ſhall drinke and be moued, and be mad, becauſe of the ſword that I will ſend amongſt them. Therefore ſay thou vnto them, thus ſaith the lord of hoſts the God of Iſrael, drinke &amp; be drunk, &amp; ſpew, &amp; fall &amp; riſe no more, becauſe of the ſword which I will ſend
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:183914:150"/> amongſt them: but if they refuſe to take the cup at thine hand to drinke, then tell them, thus ſaith the lord of hoſtes, you ſhall certainly drinke; for Ioe, I begin to plague the citie where my name is called vpon, and ſhould you goe free? you ſhall not goe quit. For I will call for a ſword vpon all the inhabitants of the earth, ſaith the lord of hoſtes. The Lord ſhall roare from aboue, and thruſtout his voice from his holy habitation, hee ſhall roare vpon his habitation, and crie aloud, the ſound ſhall be to the ends of the earth, for Lord hath a controuerſie with the nations, and will enter into iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with all fleſh, and hee will giue them that are wicked to the ſword, ſaith the lord. Thus ſaith the lord of hoſts, behold, a plague ſhall goe forth from nation to nation, and a great whirle. wind ſhall be raiſed vp from the coſtes of the earth, and the ſlaine of the lord ſhal be at that day, from one end of the earth to the other end of the earth: they
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:183914:150"/> ſhall not bee mourned, neither gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, nor buried; but ſhalbe as the dung vpon the ground. Thus my ſoule was farre off from peace, I forgat proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, remembring mine affliction, and my mourning, the wormwood, and the gall, my ſoule hath them in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and is humbled in me.

It is good for a man that he beare the yoke in his youth, for the Lord wil not forſake for euer, but though hee ſend affliction, yet wil he haue compaſſion, according to the multitude of his mercies: for he doth not puniſh willingly, nor afflict the children of men in ſtamping vnder his feete all the priſoners of the earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore then is the liuing man ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull?

For in the middeſt of thee the fathers ſhall eate their ſonnes, and the ſonnes ſhall eate their fathers, and I will execute iudgement in thee, &amp; the whole remnant of thee wil I ſcatter into all the winds: the third part of thee ſhal die with the peſtilence, &amp; with famine

Thou haſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed mine holy things, and haſt pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted my ſabbaths: in thee haue they taken gifts to ſhed bloud, thou haſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vſurie, and the increaſe, and thou haſt defrauded thy neighbour by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, and haſt forgotten mee, ſaith the Lord God. There is a conſpiracie of her Prophets in the middeſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, like a roaring lyon, rauening the pray, they haue deuoured ſoules, they haue taken the riches and precious things, they haue made her many wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, in the middeſt therof her prieſts haue broken my law, and haue defiled my holy things, they haue put no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the holy and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, neither diſcerned betweene the vncleane and the cleane, and haue hid their eyes from my ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths, and I am prophaned amongſt them her Princes in the middeſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are like wolues rauening the

The people of the land haue violently oppreſſed by ſpoyling, and robbing, and haue vexed the poore and the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yea they haue oppreſſed the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger<note place="margin">Ezechiel.</note> againſt right: &amp; I ſought for a man amongſt them, that ſhould make vp the hedge and ſtand in the gap before me for the land that I ſhould not deſtroy it; but I found none. Behold therefore I haue ſmitten my hand vpon the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſnes that thou haſt vſed and vpon the bloud which hath beene ſhed in the middeſt of thee. Can their hart endure, or can their hands bee ſtrong in the dayes that I ſhall haue to doe with thee? I the Lord haue ſpoken it and I will doe it; as they gather ſiluer, and braſſe, and iron, and lead, and tinne, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the middeſt of the furnace, to blow the fire vpon it, &amp; to melt it; ſo wil I gather you in mine anger, and in my wrath, and will put you there, and melt you, and you ſhal know that I the Lord

Say vnto them, as I liue, ſaith the Lord God, I deſire not the death of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, but that the wicked turne from his way and liue. Turne you, turne you from your euill waies, for why will you die? When the righteous turneth from his righteouſnes, and committeth<note place="margin">Cap. 33.</note> iniquitie, hee ſhall euen die thereby. But if the wicked returne from his wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes, and doe that which is lawfull and right, he ſhal liue therby. Yee leane vpon your ſwords, yee worke abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and yee defile euery one his neighbours wife, ſhould yee then poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe the land? Alſo thou ſonne of man, the children of thy people, that talke of thee by the walles, and in the doores of houſes, and ſpeake one to another, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one to his brother, ſaying, Come I pray you and heare what is the word that commeth from the Lord, for they come vnto thee, as the people vſeth to come, and my people ſit before thee, &amp; heare thy words, but they wil not do
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:183914:155"/> them: for with their mouths they make ieſtes, and their heart goeth after their couetouſnes, &amp; loe, thou art vnto them as a ieſting ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voice, and canſing well, for they heare thy wordes, but doe them not. Say thus vnto them, thus ſaith the LORD GOD, as I liue, ſo ſurely they that are in the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late places ſhall fall by the ſworde, and him that is in the open field will I giue vnto the beaſts to be deuoured; and they that be in the courts, and in the caues ſhall die of the peſtilence; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhall they know that I am the Lord, when I haue laid the land deſolate, and waſte becauſe of their abominations which they haue committed.

The weake haue you not ſtrengthned, and the ſick haue you not
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:183914:156"/> healed, neither haue you bound vp the broken, nor brought again that which was driuen away, neither haue you ſought that which was loſt, but with cruelty and with rigour haue you ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them, and they were ſcattred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſhepheard; and when they were diſperſed they were deuoured of all the beaſts of the field. Therefore ye ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards heare the word of the Lord: As I liue ſaith the lord God, ſurely becauſe my flock was ſpoiled and my ſheepe were deuoured of all the beaſts of the field, hauing no ſhepheard, neither did my ſhepheards ſeeke my ſheepe: but my ſhepheards fedde themſelues, and fed not my ſheepe. Behold, I come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſhepheards, and will require my ſheepe at their hands, and cauſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ceaſe from feeding the ſheepe, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall the ſhepheards feede them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues any more, for I will deliuer my ſheepe from their mouths, &amp; they ſhall no more deuoure them. For thus ſaith the lord God, behold I will ſearch my

And ye my ſheepe, the ſheepe of my paſture, are mine, and I am your GOD, ſaith the Lord God. A new heart alſo wil I giue you, and a new ſpirit will I put within you, and I wil take away the ſtony heart out of your bodie, and will giue you an heart of fleſh, and I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walke in my ſtatutes, &amp; ye ſhall keepe my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and do them, and ye ſhall dwell in the land that I gaue to your fathers, and ye ſhalbe my people, and I wil bee

For all ſhall go to one place, all was of the duſt, &amp; all ſhall returne to the duſt. But though after our skins, wormes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this body, yet ſhal we ſee God in our fleſh, whom we our ſelues ſhall ſee, and our eies ſhall behold and none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for vs, though our reines be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed within vs, for our redeemer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, and he ſhall ſtand the laſt on the earth, and he ſhall bring euery worke to iudgment, with euery ſecret thought whether it be good or euill.

So Chriſt was once offred to take away the ſins of many, and vnto them that looke for him, he ſhall appeare the ſecond time vnto ſaluation; for we muſt all appeare before the iudgement ſeate of Chriſt, that euery man may receiue the things that he hath done in his body, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that he hath done in his body; according to that he hath done, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or euill. This death the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto which all fleſh ſhal come, is either an entrance or gate to perpetual liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and pleaſure, or to perpetual priſon and paine: the death which maketh entrance to euerlaſting paine is termed Ghoſtly, and the ſicknes which war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of the ſame is alſo Ghoſtly: which Ghoſtly ſicknes and infection procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of the malice of Satan, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our owne wicked nature, driuing all of whom it taketh hold ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to errour in religion, errour in life, or errour in both.

The like wherof is affirmed in the 2.

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hoſoeuer deſireth to be moſt conuerſant with God, muſt apply himſelfe often to his deuout praiers, and to the reading of holy ſcriptures: for in his praiers, he talketh with God, and in his reading of holy ſcriptures, God talketh with him. In which ſcripture he ſhall find noted, that praier is ſometime taken for euery good worke, as vpon that ſaying of the Apoſtle, Praie conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, the learned do interpret, that he onely may be ſaid to pray continually, that diſchargeth his duty well in euery good worke continually, ſo that a iuſt and righteous man neuer ceaſeth to pray vntill he ceaſe to be righteous: for no man can pray or praiſe God conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually with his lips, neither is ſuch a prayer or praiſe of God without the deſire or conſent of the heart, pleaſing
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:183914:188"/> or acceptable vnto God, but hee that prayeth vnto God, or praiſeth God by his good workes and conuerſation, he doth and may continually pray and praiſe God moſt affectionatly glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him by his works. True prayer alſo is thus defined: Prayer is a moſt godly affection of the minde directed vnto God, and this affection is a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Chriſtian deſire: and euery god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Chriſtian deſire may be termed a praier. When our affection therfore and deſire is directed vnto God, it go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as a meſſenger ſent from man to God, and it entreth into the ſanctuary of God, vnto which place our fleſh cannot be admitted: our praier is alſo a kind of petitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preferred vnto God for al things neceſſary &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient; nether doth it beſeeme any child of God to aske of God ſuch things as are not meet but ſuch things are to be asked which are neceſſary for the ſoules health; neither ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any thing be ſaid to be asked in the name of our Sauior, which is not
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:183914:188"/> asked for ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſake. To pray alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, is to ſend forth the ſorowful ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our ſoules: &amp; not many eloque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; glorious words. And to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend this duty the more vnto vs, theſe godly ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are of great force, which we finde in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 18. and <hi>Ierem</hi> 33. Be not let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to pray often, but cry vnto God and he will heare thee. To the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s alſo of praier, the examples of all the ſaints of God are of great force who while they liued in the world perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in praier, with one heart together with the women, and <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of Ieſus, as it is ſaid in the <hi>Acts.</hi> Our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt alſo was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed often to pray, as in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Goſpell it apeareth, not that he needed praier when of himſelfe he had power of all things; but to giue vs an example of diligent prayer he being vnwilling that we ſhould ſlothfully and negligently practiſe that which he ſo diligently by his exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple had taught: It is a ſhame therefore for any Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:183914:189"/> diſciple to be ignorant of that which their Lord &amp; maſter Chriſt did ſo dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently teach, &amp; as great ſhame it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to doe that which their maſter Chriſt did ſo often, eſpecially ſeeing praier is a matter ſo profitable &amp; gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto vs: for more may one Saint of God preuaile by his prayer, then many miſerable ſinners can do by their force: more doth one godly man get from heauen in an houre by his praier, then many thouſand of armed Souldiers can get vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth by their force and armes. Praier alſo will make vs to triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our ſpirituall enemies, as Saint <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> declareth, ſaying: This is the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die by which we conſume all the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of our vices, that ſo often as we feele our ſelues pricked with ſinne, ſo often wee ſhould turne our ſelues to ſeeke help by ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
